```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)

github_sha_link <- function(sha) {
  glue::glue(
    "([changelog: {substr(sha, 1, 6)}]",
    "(https://github.com/gadenbuie/js4shiny-drumkit/commit/{sha})"
  )
}
```

I've setup a basic [index.html](index.html) to get us started.

## Add the drumkit image

Typically images are included in a page using the `<img>` tag.

Let's try that first

```html
<!-- PUT SVG HERE -->
<img src="drumkit.svg" />
```

This doesn't work the way we want.
Compare the [drumkit.svg](drumkit.svg) document
with what we see in the developer console.
The SVG document is XML (like HTML),
but uses a different set of tags.

In order to be able to access the structure of the SVG,
we need to drop the whole SVG into our HTML page.
