I've setup a basic [index.html](index.html) to get us started.

## Add the drumkit image

Typically images are included in a page using the `<img>` tag.

Let's try that first

```html
<!-- PUT SVG HERE -->
<img src="drumkit.svg" />
```

This doesn't work the way we want.
Compare the [drumkit.svg](drumkit.svg) document
with what we see in the developer console.
The SVG document is XML (like HTML),
but uses a different set of tags.

In order to be able to access the structure of the SVG,
we need to drop the whole SVG into our HTML page.

## Change the drumkit's colors

I've include some styles in a `<style>` tag 
at the bottom of the page.
Use these to change the colors of the drumkit
and get a sense for the structure of the svg:

* Individual SVG elements: `polygon`, `path`, `ellipse`
* Each have classes: `.drum-side.kick`
* Are also grouped together, with ID for group: `#kick`
* Note that last class is the same as the sound we want to play: `class="drum-side kick"` means we should use a kick drum sound.

Here are suggestions for colors for the drumkit.

- black stands
- gray rims
- purple drums
- dark purple bottoms
- white kick front
- yellow symbols
- orange hover

Check out the hover effect!
