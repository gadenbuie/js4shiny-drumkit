```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)

github_sha_link <- function(sha) {
  glue::glue(
    "([changelog: {substr(sha, 1, 6)}]",
    "(https://github.com/gadenbuie/js4shiny-drumkit/commit/{sha})"
  )
}
```

I've setup a basic [index.html](index.html) to get us started.

## Add the drumkit image

Typically images are included in a page using the `<img>` tag.

Let's try that first

```html
<!-- PUT SVG HERE -->
<img src="drumkit.svg" />
```
